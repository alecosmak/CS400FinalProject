Other notes or comments to the grader:
	Input files are assumed to be named like ("2019-1") and have lines of data like ("2019-7-1,Farm 1,25"), like in the sample files. The input files must also be from only the year and month as stated in their title. FarmIDs are trimmed of whitespace and can be any String as long as there is one character excluding "". Farm IDs are also sorted as strings so ordering may look strange. All table columns can be sorted by clicking the column headers. When there is errors in a day's data, that line is skipped but the rest of the data is entered. When a duplicate date and farmID is inserted, the weight will be replaced.
